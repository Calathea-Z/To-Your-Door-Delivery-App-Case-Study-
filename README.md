# To-Your-Door-Delivery-App-Case-Study-

This app was meant to be a case study of a delivery type app such as Door Dash or Grub Hub. It was reverse engineered from these type
of apps. 

Main Technologies used:
-Expo CLI
-React Native
-React Redux
-Sanity
-Tailwind.css

Getting Started:

1. This app will not be fully functional on the web and to run this app you will need to install Expo CLI for development.
        - Expo CLI installation instructions: https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/
2. run npm i in your terminal to install all other neccesary dependencies. 
3. run npx expo start to initialize the development server. 
4. You will then need to download the Expo Go app onto your phone and from here you can view the app 
    or the edits you make to it in real time.
    
 Future Features:
  1. Payment functionality. 
  2. Real-time connection to an actual restaurant Point-of-Sale system.
